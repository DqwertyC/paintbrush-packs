# Paintbrush Packs
Datapack and Resourcepack for 1.20 snapshots that adds paintbrushes to the game!
Create a paintbrush in a smithing table with a bowl, brush, and dye.
Right click with the brush to dye blocks.

Now works on all blocks in the "colored blocks" category of the creative menu.
Keeps block orientation and NBT for banners and shulker boxes. Beds are a little wonky, but still work.

By default, painting will paint "through" transparent blocks to solid blocks behind them. Croucing disables this behavior.

Thanks to [yuitaa](https://github.com/yuitaa) for adding code to make the unbreaking enchantment work!
